#### Evolution

> From traditional Print newspapers to Digital news feeds

When newspapers transformed and made its way into mobile devices, a new era of news reporting began. No longer bound by a physical form, news around the world  is now readily available at our fingertips, literally, via the latest technological gadgets. The time for news to go from the newsroom to print has also decreased to a matter of seconds. Having the latest news has become  a norm.

> From Black-white television to Youtube

Long gone are the days where we have to wait patiently for the daily news on our favourite channels. News programmes have gone online, making news available on-demand, sometimes even before telecast. We want it to fit our lifestyles instead of changing ourselves to fit it.

> From 2d graphs to Interactive visuals

With the vast increase in the volume of data accessible to us, we are no longer satisfied with simple statistics. A single set of data could show us a myriad of information, by using different perspectives to process the data. Set the context for the information by selecting specific details (e.g. demographics, geographical location) instead of assuming trends just from \"the average\".

#### Digital journalism

*Digital journalism = Digital news + Youtube + Interactive visuals*

When everything comes together, the next level emerges. Having tools to visualise the data together with the narrative, we want it to tell us while we explore the different trends and patterns.

#### Google and its innovation

*[Google News Lab](http://googleblog.blogspot.sg/2015/06/introducing-news-lab.html)* is the latest platform released by Google to empower the media in news reporting. It provides capability for research, reporting, distribution and optimisation of journalism.
