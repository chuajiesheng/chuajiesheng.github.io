#### What do all Singaporean males have in common?

*National service.*

It is a phase that we all go through, albeit in different conditions. In two years, we learn to live with people from all walks of life.

This is where we learn that we are not individuals but a single entity. Either we band together to survive or die divided.

To lead the pack, first you need to be part of the pack. Understand the dynamics then use it to influence the pack.

We understood the intended purpose behind the conscription, and we followed through together, regardless of the difficulties faced. No one gets left behind.

Never give up, and pull each other along. We will complete this as one. In times of need, I know we will be there. We will face it, and we will overcome it.

Fire free.
