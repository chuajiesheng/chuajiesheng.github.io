> Feelings remain even when the physical is gone 

#### Behind you

Use the past as a reminder of your abilities, as motivation to propel you into a better future.

#### Limited and limitless

What we have in this world is limited.
The result does not matter, just try as hard as you could.
It is when you fall, that you learn to stand up. 
Like what we learn as a baby.

> Enjoy while you can, and never give up trying.
