####  Where we risk is where we strive
Scott Adams mentioned in his book, *How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big*, 
> Where there is a tolerance for risk, there is often talent.

When we want it enough, we will accept the risk it takes to bring us to the destination. Look at the risks we dare to take and we will know where we belong.

I am looking forward to my skydiving trip.
