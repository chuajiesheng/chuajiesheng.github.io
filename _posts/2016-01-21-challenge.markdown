#### It's been a while

Over the past few months, much has happened.

* Participated in the annual ThoughtWorks' Latin America Away Day on 5 November
* Presented at [Agile Tour Bangkok 2015](http://www.agiletourbkk.org/) on 21 November
* Presented at [vodQA](http://twsg.github.io/vodqa/) on 16 December

Indeed, it has been an amazing 2015 and 2016 will be even better.

#### 2016 ahead

This year the heat is on:

* Masters in Applied Information System at Singapore Management University
* Continue pressing for changes in ThoughtWorks Singapore
* Enable true agility in the government 
* Mentor Youth Expedition Project
* Provide better education via [MugPug](www.mugpug.co)
* Expose more students to computational learning (after our first successful run in December). Coming soon [Yellow-Helmets](www.yellow-helmets.co).

#### Being the change maker
It has never been easy, trying to change myself, my partner and everything around me. That is the thrill that life brings you.
