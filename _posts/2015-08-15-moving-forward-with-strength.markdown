#### Fears

Everyone have fears, what are yours?
For me, I am not confident as a swimmer, as a runner and as a speaker.
But these terrestrial challenges are not going to stop me.

#### Swimming

I have always wanted to take open water diving course. But I hesitated because of the pre-requisite of swimming 200m without aids.
Now I have overcome it!
I completed my theory lesson  (a 240-page book in 6 days) and my confined water dives, which included my swimming proficiency test!

I made it.

#### Runner

Conscription is compulsory for every Singaporean male. Two years of our youth dedicated to the country. 
Learning to defend it, and fight for it.
After two years of being a full time military personnel, we need to maintain our fitness for at least 10 years. A fitness test is administered annually to ensure this.
The time for me to take my fitness test has come.

But I have not trained for it, as there are more important things to prepare for! (My talk and my diving course)

#### Speaking

Generally, I am not confident as a speaker. But this time, I made a leap forward.
I signed up to give a talk at a conference in Cambodia in the coming week.
I prepared my slides and also practised for it. (More practice to come though...)
I want to do my best and be in top form, then seek feedback for future improvement.

My next challenge awaits.
