#### The physical world
All of us have experienced the pain of a loved one departing the physical world. Depending on religious views, we may perhaps believe in reuniting with our loved ones when our time is up.

But what is the chain that makes some people reluctant to leave this world? What makes this departure so saddening?

#### When we depart
What should our next generation inherit? Should it be upkeeping of traditions for the afterlife or simple memories of our teachings?

#### For me
Just let it be a simple reunion following departure. For I do not know what is beyond this world but I can be certain of what I leave behind.
